# ADR-0001: MetalFormingAdvisor ⊣ Metal Forming Plant Operations Governor architecture

## Status

Accepted. `cloud-itonami-isic-2591` promoted from `:spec` to
`:implemented` in the `kotoba-lang/industry` registry, following the
verified fresh-scaffold protocol established by prior actors in this
fleet.

## Context

`cloud-itonami-isic-2591` publishes an OSS blueprint for a forging/
pressing/stamping/roll-forming and powder-metallurgy plant's **plant
operations coordination** (production-batch product-category/weight/
defect-rate data logging, forging-press/stamping-press/roll-forming-
mill/powder-metallurgy-press-and-sinter-line maintenance scheduling,
safety-concern flagging, and outbound forged/pressed/stamped/roll-
formed/powder-metallurgy part shipment coordination). Like every actor
in this fleet, the blueprint alone is not an implementation: this ADR
records the governed-actor architecture that promotes it to real,
tested code, following the same langgraph StateGraph + independent
Governor + Phase 0->3 rollout pattern established across the
cloud-itonami fleet.

The closest architectural analog is `cloud-itonami-isic-2593`
(Manufacture of cutlery, hand tools and general hardware): both are
back-office coordination actors for a fixed processing PLANT with
heavy manufacturing equipment and a real physical safety dimension,
and both share the same four-op shape (`:log-production-batch`/
`:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment`)
and the same two-entity verified/registered gate structure (equipment
for maintenance scheduling, batch for shipment coordination). The two
verticals are, however, distinct plants with distinct hazard profiles
and distinct positions in the ISIC 259 group: 2591 is the PRIMARY
metal-forming PROCESS shop -- typically a job shop/subcontractor
turning raw metal stock (billets, blanks, coil, metal powder) into
near-net-shape forged/pressed/stamped/roll-formed/sintered parts for
downstream manufacturers, including 2593's own cutlery/hand-tool/
hardware shop and 2599's own other-fabricated-metal-product shops --
while 2593 is the specific downstream shop that forges/grinds/heat-
treats/finishes stock into a named consumer product family (cutlery,
hand tools, general hardware). 2591's central physical hazards are
forging-press/stamping-press pinch/crush hazard, high-temperature-
forging burn/radiant-heat exposure, roll-forming-mill entanglement
hazard, and powder-metallurgy combustible-metal-dust/inhalation
exposure, while 2593's is sharp-edge laceration risk from freshly
forged/ground blades and edges, forging-hammer pinch/crush hazard,
grinding-wheel/abrasive-dust exposure, and heat-treatment-furnace
burn/radiant-heat exposure. This build mirrors 2593's architecture
closely but adapts the hazard profile and equipment/product vocabulary
to the forging/pressing/stamping/roll-forming and powder-metallurgy
plant: 2591's permanent equipment-actuation block guards a forging
press/stamping press/roll-forming mill/powder-metallurgy press-and-
sinter line (`:actuate-forge-press-line?`) rather than a forging
hammer/grinding wheel (`:actuate-forge-grind-line?`); and 2591's
production-batch record declares a `:product-category` (spanning
forged parts, pressed parts, stamped parts, roll-formed parts, powder-
metallurgy parts, and forging billets, per ISIC 2591's own scope)
rather than 2593's `:product-category` covering cutlery, hand tools,
general hardware, garden tools, kitchen utensils, and lock hardware.

`cloud-itonami-isic-2591` is also distinct from two sibling classes in
the same ISIC 259 group: `cloud-itonami-isic-2592` (Treatment and
coating of metals -- a distinct surface-finishing/heat-treatment
service, not a shaping process) and `cloud-itonami-isic-2599`
(Manufacture of other fabricated metal products n.e.c. -- other
specific downstream end-products not elsewhere classified, `:maturity
:spec` in `kotoba-lang/industry` as of this build). ISIC 2591 is the
specific "forging, pressing, stamping and roll-forming of metal;
powder metallurgy" class: a plant that shapes metal stock via forging,
pressing, stamping, roll-forming, or powder-metallurgy press-and-
sinter consolidation into near-net-shape parts or components -- a
distinct plant, distinct process shape (bulk-metal shaping, not
surface treatment/coating, not a specific named consumer product), and
this build follows the 2593-style four-op propose-only pattern
specified for this class.

This vertical has NO pre-existing `kotoba-lang/metalforming`-style
capability library to wrap (verified: no such repo exists). This build
therefore uses self-contained domain logic — pure functions in
`metalforming.registry` (equipment/batch verification, shipment-weight
recompute, product-category validation, defect-rate plausibility
validation) are re-verified independently by the governor, the same
"ground truth, not self-report" discipline established across prior
actors (most directly `cloud-itonami-isic-2593`'s `hardwaremfg.registry`).

This blueprint's own `:itonami.blueprint/governor` keyword,
`:metal-forming-plant-operations-governor`, is grep-verified UNIQUE
fleet-wide (`gh search code "metal-forming-plant-operations-governor"
--owner cloud-itonami`, zero hits before this repo was created).

## Decision

### Decision 1: Self-contained domain logic (no external forging/pressing/stamping/roll-forming capability library to wrap)

Unlike actors that delegate to pre-existing domain libraries, this
forging/pressing/stamping/roll-forming and powder-metallurgy vertical
has NO pre-existing capability library to wrap. The equipment/batch-
verification / shipment-weight / product-category / defect-rate
validation functions live as pure functions in `metalforming.registry`
and are re-verified independently by `metalforming.governor` — the
same "ground truth, not self-report" discipline established across
prior actors (most directly `cloud-itonami-isic-2593`'s
`hardwaremfg.registry`).

### Decision 2: Coordination, not control — scope boundary at the back-office

This actor is **strictly back-office coordination** of forging/
pressing/stamping/roll-forming and powder-metallurgy plant operations.
It does NOT:
- Control the forging press, stamping press, roll-forming mill or powder-metallurgy press-and-sinter line directly
- Make plant-safety or materials-safety decisions (exclusive to the human plant supervisor)
- Actuate the forging press, stamping press, roll-forming mill or powder-metallurgy press-and-sinter line

All proposals are `:effect :propose` only. The advisor proposes; the
governor validates; escalation paths funnel to human plant-supervisor
approval. This is not a replacement for the supervisor's authority —
it is a proposal-screening and documentation layer.

**CRITICAL SAFETY BOUNDARY**: forging/pressing/stamping/roll-forming
and powder-metallurgy manufacturing has real physical hazards
(forging-press/stamping-press pinch/crush hazard, high-temperature-
forging burn/radiant-heat exposure, roll-forming-mill entanglement
hazard, powder-metallurgy combustible-metal-dust/inhalation exposure).
Safety-concern flagging NEVER auto-commits. All safety concerns
escalate immediately to human review.

### Decision 3: Safety-concern escalation — always human sign-off

`:flag-safety-concern` (forging-press/stamping-press pinch/crush
hazard, high-temperature-forging burn/radiant-heat exposure, roll-
forming-mill entanglement hazard, powder-metallurgy combustible-metal-
dust/inhalation exposure, equipment-safety concern) ALWAYS escalates,
never auto-commits. This is not a "low-stakes proposal" — it is a
circuit-breaker that must reach human authority.

### Decision 4: Two independent verified/registered gates (equipment AND batch), not one

Like `cloud-itonami-isic-2593`, this vertical has TWO entity kinds
each gating a different op: `:schedule-maintenance` independently
verifies the referenced **equipment** unit's own `:verified?`/
`:registered?` fields; `:coordinate-shipment` independently verifies
the referenced **batch**'s own `:verified?`/`:registered?` fields.
Both are the same "plant/batch record must be independently
verified/registered before any action" HARD invariant applied to the
two distinct record kinds this domain actually has.
`:coordinate-shipment` additionally independently recomputes whether a
batch's own recorded shipped-to-date weight plus the proposal's own
claimed weight would exceed the batch's own recorded production
weight — never taken on the advisor's self-report.

### Decision 5: HARD invariants (no override)

Four HARD governor invariants (elaborated into ten concrete checks in
`metalforming.governor`, mirroring `cloud-itonami-isic-2593`'s own
elaboration of its HARD invariants into concrete checks) block
proposals and cannot be overridden by human approval:
1. Plant/batch record (equipment for maintenance, batch for shipment) must be independently verified/registered before any action is taken against it, and a shipment's weight must independently recompute within the batch's own logged production weight
2. Proposals must be `:effect :propose` only (never direct equipment control)
3. Any proposal touching forging/pressing-line-equipment control, or direct forge/press-line actuation, is permanently blocked
4. The op allowlist is closed — `:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` only

## Consequences

(+) Forging/pressing/stamping/roll-forming and powder-metallurgy plant
operations back-office now has a documented, governed, auditable
coordination layer that funnels all decisions through independent
validation before human approval.

(+) The "coordination, not control" boundary is explicit in code: all
`:effect :propose`, all real-world actuation requires human plant-
supervisor sign-off.

(+) Scope is bounded and verifiable: four HARD invariants (elaborated
into ten concrete governor checks) protect against scope creep into
unauthorized equipment operation or forge/press-line actuation. Safety
concerns are a circuit-breaker, not a threshold.

(+) Safety-critical discipline is explicit: safety-concern flagging
cannot be rate-limited, suppressed, or auto-decided by phase gate.
Human review is mandatory.

(-) Still a simulation/proposal layer, not a real plant-operations
control system. Equipment actuation and forge/press-line operation
remain human-controlled via external channels.

(-) No integration with real plant-management databases (equipment
telemetry, batch tracking, freight dispatch) — this is a standalone
coordinator blueprint.

## Verification

- `cloud-itonami-isic-2591`: `clojure -M:test` green (all tests pass;
  see the superproject ADR and `kotoba-lang/industry` registry entry
  for the exact `Ran N tests containing M assertions, 0 failures, 0
  errors` output, verified from an independent fresh clone), `clojure
  -M:lint` clean, `clojure -M:dev:run` demo narrative exercises
  proposal submission, escalation, and every HARD-hold scenario
  directly (not-propose-effect, unknown-op, equipment-not-verified,
  batch-not-verified, shipment-weight-exceeded, forge-press-line-
  actuate-blocked, already-scheduled, invalid-product-category,
  invalid-defect-rate).
- All source is `.cljc` (portable ClojureScript / JVM / nbb) — no
  JVM-only interop; the actor graph is invoked exclusively via
  `langgraph.graph/run*` (not `.invoke`, which is not cljs-portable).
- Audit ledger is append-only, all decisions are traced; every settled
  request (commit or hold) leaves exactly one ledger fact.
- `deps.edn` pins `io.github.kotoba-lang/langgraph` and
  `io.github.kotoba-lang/langchain` via `:local/root` directly in the
  top-level `:deps` (not only under a `:dev` alias), so a bare
  `clojure -M:test` resolves offline inside the monorepo checkout.
